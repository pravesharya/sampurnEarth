                As one of the smallest territories in the country, Goa offers us a perfect environment for our circularity project, where we could design a comprehensive, holistic, and multi-stakeholder program, covering all the steps required for setting up inclusive waste management.

                Goa though being a small state, has a very high waste generation. This is because of the presence of a good amount of industries as well as high-income levels leading to higher waste generation per capita. Most of this waste however is processed and managed by semiformal and unorganized scrap dealers and other informal collectors and aggregators...
