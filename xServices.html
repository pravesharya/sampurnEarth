                Sampurnearth takes pride in our commitment to Extended Producer
                Responsibility (EPR) as one of the first PROs in India. We
                collaborate with producers, brands and manufactures to manage
                the entire life cycle of their products responsibly. We are
                present all over India and we offer transparent and diligent
                reporting to our customers. By integrating EPR practices, we
                contribute to sustainable resource management, ensuring that
                products are recycled and disposed of responsibly.

              <div class="card-Text-D">
                Post-consumer recyclates are materials that have been used by
                consumers and then collected for recycling, turning what would
                have been waste into valuable resources for new products. This
                process not only conserves natural resources but also reduces
                greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption compared to
                producing goods from virgin materials. By incorporating
                post-consumer recyclates into manufacturing, businesses can
                significantly lessen their environmental impact while supporting
                a circular economy. With the new compliance rules for PCR coming
                into effect, we work actively with brands and producers to meet
                the same.
