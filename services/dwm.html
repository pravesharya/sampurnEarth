          Join the Movement : Recycle your Household / Commercial  waste for a
          greener India
        </div>

        <div class="T14 page-content-Text Text-Center">
          India is at a critical juncture in its environmental journey. With a
          rapidly growing population and increasing urbanization, effective
          waste management is more important than ever. By recycling your waste,
          you can play a crucial role in creating a cleaner, healthier, and more
          sustainable India.

              <u> Legal Compliance : </u>
              <div class="T12">
                Indian government regulations mandate that businesses must
                dispose of their waste through authorized recyclers only. This
                ensures that waste is handled in an environmentally responsible
                manner, reducing the ecological footprint of industries and
                offices.

              <div class="T12">
                India generates millions of tonnes of waste every year, with a
                significant portion ending up in landfills. These landfills not
                only occupy valuable land but also pose serious environmental
                hazards, including soil and water contamination. Recycling helps
                reduce the volume of waste sent to landfills, mitigating these
                risks

                Many materials commonly found in household/commercial waste,
                such as paper, plastic, and metal, can be recycled and
                repurposed. Recycling conserves natural resources by reducing
                the need for raw materials, helping to preserve our forests,
                reduce mining activities, and save energy.

                Improper waste disposal leads to pollution of our air, water,

                waste is processed in an environmentally friendly manner,
                reducing the harmful impact on our natural surroundings.
