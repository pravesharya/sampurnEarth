        <div class="H16">The Need for Post-Consumer Recyclates in India</div>

        <div class="T14 page-content-Text Text-Center">
          India, with its growing population and rapid industrialization,
          generates a substantial amount of waste. Proper management of this
          waste is crucial for environmental sustainability and public health.
          Post-consumer recyclates (PCR) offer a viable solution by converting
          waste materials into valuable resources for new products. Emphasizing
          the use of PCR is not only an environmental imperative but also aligns
          with India's commitments under global agreements like the Paris
          Accord, aiming to reduce carbon footprints and promote sustainable
          practices.

            <li>
              <u> Environmental impact : </u>
              <div class="T12">
                Utilizing PCR reduces the reliance on virgin materials, thus
                conserving natural resources and minimizing environmental
                degradation. It also significantly lowers greenhouse gas
                emissions associated with manufacturing processes.

              <u> Economic Efficiency : </u>
              <div class="T12">
                Recycling materials can be more cost-effective than producing
                new ones from raw resources. Businesses can achieve considerable
                savings and improve their bottom lines by integrating PCR into
                their supply chains.

            <li>
              <u> Regulatory Compliance : </u>
              <div class="T12">
                The Indian government has implemented stringent regulations
                under the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, and its
                subsequent amendments, mandating the use of recycled content in
                various products. Adopting PCR helps businesses comply with
                these regulations, avoiding penalties and enhancing their market
                reputation.

                Consumers are increasingly favoring brands that demonstrate a
                commitment to sustainability. Using PCR in products showcases a
                companyâ€™s dedication to environmental stewardship, improving
                brand image and customer loyalty
