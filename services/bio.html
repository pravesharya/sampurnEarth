        <div class="H16">The Need for Biogas in India</div>

        <div class="T14 page-content-Text Text-Center">
          India is grappling with significant challenges in waste management and
          energy security. With a growing population and increasing
          industrialization, the country generates an enormous amount of organic
          waste. Biogas technology offers an effective solution by converting
          organic waste into a renewable source of energy. This not only helps
          in managing waste sustainably but also provides a cleaner alternative
          to traditional fossil fuels. The Government of India, recognizing the
          potential of biogas, supports its adoption through various incentives
          and subsidies, promoting a greener and more sustainable future.

                Biogas plants process organic waste, reducing the burden on
                landfills and mitigating environmental pollution. This is
                crucial for both urban and rural areas struggling with waste
                disposal issues.

                Biogas plants capture methane emissions from decomposing organic
                matter, converting them into energy. This process reduces
                greenhouse gas emissions and helps combat climate change.

                Investing in biogas projects can lead to cost savings in waste
                management and energy procurement. Additionally, these projects
                create job opportunities and generate income from the sale of
                biogas and bio-fertilizers.
