          At Sampurn(e)arth, we are deeply committed to the upliftment and
          empowerment of Safai Saathis (waste workers) across all the regions we
          serve. Recognizing their crucial role in transforming waste into
          livelihoods, our social support services are designed to ensure that
          their work is dignified, sustainable, and seamlessly integrated into
          formal systems throughout the supply chain.
        </div>

        <div class="H16">Empowerment Through Knowledge</div>

        <div class="T14 page-content-Text">
          Our dedicated teams engage in ongoing efforts to formalize and empower
          informal waste workers. We understand that knowledge is a powerful
          tool for transformation. To this end, we conduct regular
          capacity-building sessions that equip these workers with essential
          skills and awareness. These sessions cover a broad range of topics,
          including waste segregation techniques, safety protocols, and health
          awareness. By empowering workers with knowledge, we enable them to
          perform their duties more effectively and safely.
          <br />
          <br />
          Health camps are another vital component of our support strategy.
          These camps are organized regularly to ensure that workers have access
          to basic health services. We address common health issues, provide
          medical check-ups, and distribute necessary medications. Beyond
          physical well-being, these health camps also play a crucial role in
          restoring the dignity of waste workers by showing them that their
          health and welfare matter.
        </div>

        <div class="H16">Unity in Self-Help Groups (SHGs)</div>

        <div class="T14 page-content-Text">
          We believe in the strength of unity, and this principle is embodied in
          our support for Self-Help Groups (SHGs). These groups are more than
          just collectives; they are platforms for decision-making,
          trust-building, and camaraderie. By fostering a sense of community and
          mutual support, SHGs empower workers to take collective action and
          make informed decisions about their work and lives.
          <br />
          <br />
          Within these groups, workers can share their experiences, challenges,
          and successes, creating a supportive network that promotes resilience
          and independence. The collective power of SHGs enables workers to
          negotiate better working conditions, access credit facilities, and
          undertake community projects. This unity propels them toward greater
          independence and improved livelihoods.

        <div class="H16">Government Schemes and Identification</div>

        <div class="T14 page-content-Text">
          Integration into formal systems is a critical aspect of our social
          support services. We ensure that each worker is enrolled in relevant
          government schemes that provide social security and legitimacy. These
          schemes offer a range of benefits, including health insurance, pension
          plans, and financial assistance. By connecting workers to these
          schemes, we help secure their future and enhance their economic
          stability.
          <br />
          <br />
          Official identification cards are issued to every worker, symbolizing
          acknowledgment and inclusion. These ID cards are more than just pieces
          of paper; they represent recognition of their contributions and
          integration into formal waste management systems. With these IDs,
          workers can access various government services and benefits, enhancing
          their sense of belonging and security.

        <div class="H16">Advocacy & Awareness for Scrap Dealers</div>

        <div class="T14 page-content-Text">
          Our commitment extends beyond empowering individual workers to
          advocating for systemic change within the informal scrap markets. We
          focus on raising awareness about responsible waste management
          practices among scrap dealers and their workers. By promoting the
          proper disposal of non-recyclables and discouraging harmful practices
          like burning waste, we strive to create a more sustainable and
          environmentally friendly waste management ecosystem.
          <br />
          <br />
          We work closely with scrap dealers to formalize and organize their
          operations. This includes training them on efficient sorting and
          processing techniques, helping them comply with regulatory
          requirements, and facilitating their integration into the broader
          recycling network. Through these efforts, we aim to elevate the entire
          informal sector and promote sustainable practices that benefit both
          workers and the environment.

                Our teams at the Plastic Recycling Facility (PRF) play a crucial
                role in secondary segregation of Mixed Soft Plastic into
                essential categories for processing. These workers operate the
                Fatka, Agglomeration, and Extruder units, which are vital for
                transforming plastic waste into reusable lumps and granules.
                Their work is essential for the efficient processing and
                recycling of plastic materials.

                In collaboration with municipality-owned Material Recovery
                Facilities (MRFs), we support workers engaged in the primary
                segregation of post-consumer waste. These MRFs handle waste
                streams from both urban centers and village panchayats. By
                ensuring efficient primary segregation, these workers contribute
                to the effective management of waste and the overall
                sustainability of our operations.

                These frontline workers facilitate the daily collection of
                waste, ensuring that mixed dry waste is segregated at the source
                before it reaches MRFs. Their efforts streamline the flow of
                waste from urban and rural communities, ensuring that it is
                efficiently processed and recycled. Through training and
                support, we ensure that these workers are well-equipped to
                handle their responsibilities.

                Operating around dumping grounds, these workers play a vital
                role in collecting and recycling waste. We incentivize them to
                collect Mixed Flexible Plastic and offer opportunities to join
                existing MRF operations. By integrating these workers into
                formal systems, we enhance their livelihoods and contribute to
                more effective waste management practices

                marginalized and invisible, benefit from our social support
                programs. By providing training, resources, and support, we help
                these workers improve their working conditions and integrate
                into the broader recycling network.
