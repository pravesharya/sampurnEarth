          Goa though being a small state, has a very high waste generation. This
          is because of the presence of a good amount of industries as well as
          high-income levels leading to higher waste generation per capita. Most
          of this waste however is processed and managed by semiformal and
          unorganized scrap dealers and other informal collectors and
          aggregators. 

          <br /><br />

          This program aims at mainstreaming this scrap dealer (estimated to be
          800 in Goa) into a formally organized system,  under pollution control
          guidelines while maintaining social compliance (no child labor) within
          the facility. While we are trying to drive a state policy for this,
          our project also encompasses the hand-holding of 100 scrap dealers of
          various sizes playing different roles in the recycling supply chain
          change into the integration of a formalized ecosystem of waste
          processing and handling. Our scope of work also included working with
          1000+ waste workers engaged in these facilities for safe, and
          dignified livelihoods.
