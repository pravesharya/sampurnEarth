          Under this Project, we have created multiple Plastic Recycling and
          Recovery Facilities(currently 8 operating lines) primarily located in
          the Western part of India covering the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat,
          and Goa. Currently, these 8 recycling lines can process up to 500-600
          MT/Month(6000-7,000 MT/year) of different varieties of Polyoliphins
          (LDPE, HDPE, PP, HM in rigid and flexible forms)  plastic waste at
          full capacity. <br /><br />

          These facilities are primarily designed to process low-value flexible
          plastic wastes like carry bags, garbage bags, and other kinds of
          packaging material made from flexible plastics. The facility receives
          its feedstock from different Material Recovery Facilities(MRFs) both
          privately run and with Municipal Bodies in nearby cities. This helps
          in achieving better resource recovery and better financial
          sustainability at the material recovery facilities as well. Thus they
          are also strategically located so that we can cover maximum parts of
          Maharashtra Goa and Gujarat as raw material sources. <br /><br /> 
          However, following the policy changes in the plastic waste management
          rules in the country where brands and producers are mandated to use
          recycled Polymers in their packaging material, one of our facilities
          based in Nagpur has been dedicated to producing good quality recycled
          Polymer granules. This can be used for higher applications including
          HD blow molding or PPCP injection molding for different non-food grade
          packaging applications to begin with. <br /><br />

          These facilities employ nearly 200 workers directly and also reach out
          and engage with 1500 waste workers employed or connected with the
          source supply chains including MRFs and other Plastic Aggregation
          facilities including different types of waste workers(waste pickers,
          sorters, municipal or Panchayat collection workers), etc.

                New Plastic Recycling facilities are being set up to handle
                low-value plastic waste. We have currently 8 operational

                This project has been standardizing ways to collect and recycle
                low-value plastics in a traceable and organized manner. Better
                recycling techniques to increase the circularity of plastic by
                not downcycling it but rather recycling/upcycling is also an
                activity of the project.

                A variety of programs targeting health, safety, financial, and
                legal literacy, alongside Self-Help Group formation have been
                developed for the informal waste workers forming part of the
                waste supply chain to see a more equitable distribution of the
                opportunities in the larger plastic recycling ecosystem.

                guidelines, as well as authorized disposal of the solid
                non-recyclable portion of the waste. The program will
                nevertheless ensure higher plastic waste recovery from the
                environment and recycling ensuring a circular economy.
