          As one of the smallest territories in the country, Goa offers us a
          perfect environment for our circularity project, where we could design
          a comprehensive, holistic, and multi-stakeholder program, covering all
          the steps required for setting up inclusive waste management. Our
          attempts to achieve zero-landfilling in Bicholim and Sattari Taluka
          have been recognized by NITI Aayog as the best waste management
          practices in their 2021 report. Concurrently, our alignment with the
          State Government, the Pollution Control Board (GPCB), and GWMC (Goa
          Waste Management Corporation) has helped us immensely to initiate our
          program in Goa, where we are running sustainable projects and are
          upscaling the model into other states (mainly in Maharashtra and
          Gujarat), hoping to establish a model to be followed by others in the
          industry.

          Consultation and Hand Holding along with Formalisation and
          Mainstreaming of Informal Waste Workers, and (c) Setting up and
          Running Waste Recovery facilities (at different levels of the supply
          chain including primary segregation, secondary sorting, and recycling)

              <div class="T12">
                In and around Bicholim and Sattari taluka in Goa, we have done a
                consistent IEC program for 4 years, engaging with 30 Panchayats
                and main ULBs to ensure better segregation at source. In close
                coordination with GWMC and village panchayats, we have been able
                to organize about 100 workers in these villages for the regular
                collection of dry waste. Linking the collection attempts at
                these villages with a simple database of QR codes across 50,000+
                households and commercial shops and units to keep track of
                source segregation levels has resulted in higher segregation at
                source in these levels, and therefore, better quality waste for
                processing and recycling. The collected waste then will be sent
                to the Bicholim MRF for further segregation, avoiding any
                landfilling.

              <u> Bicholim MRF (Primary Facility) : </u>
              <div class="T12">
                At the Bicholim MRF center, set up in association with Goa waste
                management corporation and Bicholim Municipal council, we
                receive up to 200 MT of Dry Waste per month, recovering up to
                50-60% of waste there for further recycling. The RDF which
                amounts to 40% is sent to designated cement factories for clean
                and scientific burning, reducing coal consumption and CO2
                emissions, achieving zero-landfilling. 

                <br /><br />
                SHGs of 50 workers from Bicholim Taluka have been formed to
                manage the waste and are an integral part of this success story.
                The workers having their income levels linked directly with the
                sales proceeds of the recyclables are invested in higher
                recovery of the recyclables, including low-value flexible
                plastics where we have linked the MRF to our low-value plastic
                recycling center at Pissurlem, covering the whole supply chain.

                We have one more secondary center at Harvalem, to take the
                recovered plastic for further segregation there. The center at
                Harvalem is also a worker-run and managed center. 

                <br /><br />
                This was received from other MRFs other than Bicholim as well as
                waste from large bulk waste generators across Goa.
